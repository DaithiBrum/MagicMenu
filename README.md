# MagicMenu
ASU coding bootcamp project one - group six


## The MagicMenu
The MagicMenu that my group and I have created as an online menu that can be accessed via a browser on a laptop or a handheld device designed for the convience of the user. Our thoughts behind this website was to create a simple way for consumers to plan out meals throughout a week give the users a chance to try new options that may have not tried before with a randomized generator that gives access to a photo of the food along with the ingredients and a link that takes the user to a new website that provides more information along with the directions to make the dish.

### What the MagicMenu offers
The MagicMenu offers a variety of different food options along with drink options both alcholic and not to make for a fun and exciting menu without the stress of planning for the week.

### Challanges faces along the way
along the way my team and I have run into many issues mainly revolving around the usage of api's and getting the javascript and page running the way we wanted. We worked everyday to come up with ideas and plans and sectioning out work to try to find different ideas and plans and would come back together to share what we have found along with picking and choosing the approaches we would take and what we would scrap. we also had to find eachothers strengths and weaknesses so that we would be able to work efficiently and affectivly making good use of the time we all had.

## How to use it
To use this website its fairly simple all you have to do is go to the website either through your desktop or a mobile device and press the genereate option to get your food options if you dont like the options you have you can hit generate again for a new list of items. At the very top of the webpage youll find a set of days each being a button that can be pressed bringing you to that designated day. For the drink options its works the same way generating one drink per click. at the very bottom of the webpage we have links to take you to different websites based on dietary needs or specific types of food one may be looking for.
